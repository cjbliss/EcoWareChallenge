# Vendor Management System Enhancement Tasks

## Overview
Enhance the existing Vendor Management System built with Next.js and Material-UI (MUI) for EcoWare, a sustainable foodware company. Improve the user interface, add advanced functionalities, and incorporate additional features to create a more robust and user-friendly experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) - UI component library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library

## MY EDITS:
### Visual:
- Used MUI components to make the website look nice, but not subtract from the user's ability to read and navigate
- Logo top left 
- Background image consistent across all pages
### Features:
- Added sort and search for each component (via the top of the toolbar)
- Added search to search through name, contact, email, phone, address, and ID fields (searchbar)
- Added cancel buttons for add and edit vendor 
- Pagination - option to have 10,25,or 50 vendors displayed (can change these options easily on my end if necessary)
- Home page (current vendors) and about page
- Vendor tags - googled different types of vendors, added ability to classify each vendor as one of those types in both the edit vendor page and through the homepage
- Additional info section for each vendor
- More info page for each vendor - can see the additional info here
- Formatting for 10-digit phone numbers automatically maps to (xxx) xxx-xxxx
- Format restrictions for email so that it has to follow x@x.x (actual email format)
- All CRUD operations work as expected
